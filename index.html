    <h2 class="heading">How it works</h2>
    <p class="content">Keystroke dynamic also called rytham typing that gets timing that is needed
      for typing of personal login data. When password and username is correct, all
      data of typing is compared with timing of genuied user. If typing for every
      key is approximate to genuied user time then login is valid, otherwise not and user
      can not pass the login.
    </p>
    <h2 class="heading">Why keystroke dynamics is usefull</h2>
    <p class="content">We are very aware that many users have various unsecure passwords for theirs
    web accounts but even somebody try to break it or allready found out, the
    algorithm for keystroke dynamic will know does this user genuied. </p>

    <h2 class="heading">What algorithm is used and how to mesure key times</h2>
    <p class="content">First we have to have tested data of genuied user, for example genuied user
      login for 7 times to ensure that we have avarage time for every key that he pressed
      for his password. Then if password is correct, use distance algorithm, I used Manhattan algorithm,
      to get time distence of genuide user and current user how tries to login. If that distance is
      above or below 10% of key avarage time, then this user is impuster.
